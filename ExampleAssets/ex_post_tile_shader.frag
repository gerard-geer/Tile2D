 * 
 * This is an example fragment shader for PostTiles. PostTile fragment
 * shaders have requirements just like the vertex shaders.
 * -Depth-testing against the previous path isn't done by OpenGL. Rather,
 *  you must implement it yourself in the fragment stage. (This example
 *  shader includes a suggestion as to how to do this.
 * -Remember, you can share with and take uniforms from the vertex shader.
 * -If the depth test fails, write out an alpha of 0. This is how the
 *  compositor knows to display the first pass rather than this one.
 * -Also remember to target GLSL version 1.2.
 * -Want to have transparent fragments? Just output a transparent fragment.
 * -The clear color used by the renderer has an alpha of zero. Therefore if
 *  you wish to output blank regions of the forward pass' color buffer, you
 *  must set the alpha to 1.0 manually.
