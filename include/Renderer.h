 * @class Renderer
 * @author Gerard Geer
 * @date 06/13/16
 * @file Renderer.h
 * @brief This is the core Renderer. It renders any Tiles added to its render
 *        queue with respect to its encapsulated Camera instance. Any "assets",
 *        such as Textures or Shaders, that Tiles use must be added to the
 *        encapsulated AssetManager prior to drawing. Note that the Shaders for
 *        the BGTile, SceneTile, and AnimTile are loaded automatically by the
 *        renderer at startup. They must be in a directory 
 *        "../Assets/Rendering Assets/Shaders/" relative to the executable.
 *        The resolution of the underlying framebuffers and window are
 *        independent.
 * 
 *        How the pipeline works:
 *        -To begin, the renderer uses two framebuffer objects, so support of
 *         FBOs is essential.
 *        -First of all to draw a Tile you must add it to the render queue.
 *        -Second, the render queue is sorted with all opaque Tiles sorted from
 *         front to back, then all transparent Tiles are sorted from back to
 *         to front.
 *        -Next the BG-, Scene-, and AnimTiles are rendered into a first,
 *         forward framebuffer.
 *        -Then all of the DefTiles are rendered into a second, deferred
 *         framebuffer, with the depth and color buffers of the first pass made
 *         available to them. (As well as all of their custom textures, and
 *         using their custom shaders.)
 *        -DefTiles must do their own parallax calculations in their vertex
 *         Shader to allow for disabling them.
 *        -DefTiles must also do their own depth-test against the depth buffer
 *         of the first pass, also to make for being able to disable it.
 *        -If a DefTile fragment fails a depthtest, it needs to output an alpha
 *         of zero.
 *        -Finally the two buffers are stitched together and drawn onto a full
 *         screen quad. They're stitched together by mixing a texel from the 
 *         forward pass with the deferred pass based on the deferred pass texel's
 *         alpha.
 *        
 *        How Tile rendering works:
 *        -Each Tile subclass overrides a pure virtual method from Tile: 
 *         render(). This method is passed a pointer to the calling Renderer
 *         instance.
 *        -The Tile sets all the uniforms and constructs the parallax 
 *         transformation matrix of itself, then calls glDrawArrays() on the
 *         common VAO for every Tile stored within the Renderer.
